# This will be an ongoing update of a webfront page where I will host a portfolio of completed projects showing off the skills I have obtained throughout the course of the UCSD coding bootcamp.

Though it may looks a little bleak and barebones at first, as the class progresses and my skills grow it should show dividends and also be good practice to continually update the "storefront" of my portfolio.

This should contain a link to the repository and a link to the hosted website containing my portfolio.
